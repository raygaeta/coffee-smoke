# Animated Smoke Effect with Perlin Noise Optimization â˜•ðŸ’¨

#### This project demonstrates how to create a realistic, animated smoke effect emanating from a coffee mug using WebGL and Three.js. By leveraging Perlin noise textures, we achieve smooth, natural-looking animations while optimizing performance. This lesson is perfect for developers interested in crafting immersive visuals for interactive projects or applications.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

### ðŸŽ¥ Realistic Smoke Animation
#### Simulates the soft, wispy motion of smoke rising from a coffee mug, creating a soothing and lifelike effect.

### âš¡ Optimized with Perlin Noise
#### Utilizes Perlin noise textures to drive the smoke's motion, significantly reducing computational load compared to traditional particle systems.

### ðŸ’» GPU-Driven Efficiency
#### Harnesses the power of shaders to handle animation directly on the GPU, ensuring high performance and smooth rendering.

### ðŸŽ¨ Customizable Effects
#### Easily tweak parameters such as density, speed, and color to create unique smoke effects tailored to your design
